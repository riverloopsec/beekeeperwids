Introduction
--------------

beekeeperwids is a Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) for
IEEE 802.15.4 (and can be extended for upper layers such as ZigBee, 6loWPAN, etc).

It was developed by River Loop Security, LLC and released at Troopers14.
It is currently unmaintained.
River Loop Security (riverloopsecurity.com) specailizes in security asssesments including
low-level embeeded systems, custom hardware, and specailized radio protocols.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

This is currently a beta release, developed to show the feasibility
of intrusion detection techniques to 802.15.4. We aim to continue to
add detection modules to this, and we ask for the contributions of
other researchers in contributing additions both to the detection
modules, and to the core architecture as desired.


Install
--------------
Run `sudo python setup.py install` (or `make install`).

Note that this currently assumes a Linix system where it can place the config files into
/opt/kbwids/. If this is not the case, you may need to edit setup.py to install them
elsewhere (or move them yourself). If they are not installed to the default location,
set KBWIDS\_CONFIG\_PATH to point to the folder they are instlled in.


Configuration
--------------

Install the software on your drone. Then execute 'zbdrone -run'.

Install the software on your WIDS backend (if different than the drone computer).
Then execute 'zbwids -run'.

Logs will be written to the logging directory, which is defined by the KBWIDS_LOG_PATH 
enviroment variable, if set, and otherwise defaults to the temp directory of your system. 
The logs are named for the system component which is producing them.

Organization
------------

This software uses the KillerBee framework and the 802.15.4 (dot15d4)
layer of Scapy (available in the scapy-com repository).
